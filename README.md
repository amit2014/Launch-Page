# Launch Page

Launching a product or service soon? Use Launch Page to collect email addresses to notify when your product or service has launched.

## Installation

Clone this repo, modify config.json with page details, copy/rename secret.json.dist to secret.json, add API keys to secret.json, and boom, you're ready to go.

## Looking For The Old Version?

I had an old LaunchRock style launch page that used a fullscreen background image. It was very poorly coded, and that style of launch page isn't as big anymore. If you still want this version, I have tagged it and created downloads for it.
