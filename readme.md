Launching Soon pages seem to be viral. That's why we made the Launch Page.

Launch Page is a simple php site that lets you host your own launching soon page. It integrates with MailChimp's API to add emails to your MailChimp lists.

##Getting started with Launch Page

1. Download and unzip to a directory on your web server
2. Upload your logo (less then 400px wide) and a background image (should be at least 1600 x 1200 to prevent pixilation)
3. Open up settings.php and change it to fit your site
4. Send the link out to your new launch page!

###Getting Your MailChimp API key

Simply go to http://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api

###Get the id of your MailChimp list

1. Go to your lists in MailChimp
2. Under settings, click list settings and unique id
3. The unique id will be at the bottom
